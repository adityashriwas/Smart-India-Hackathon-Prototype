1. System components (top-level)

Mobile App / PWA (Citizen)

Photo/video capture, GPS, text/voice input, optional anonymity, presigned upload to storage, submit report metadata.

Ingestion API (Backend)

Receives report metadata, returns presigned S3/IPFS upload URL, writes minimal record to RDBMS, enqueues report for processing, triggers blockchain write (or schedules it as transaction via relayer).

Off-chain DB + Geo Layer

PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geo queries, ward/department mapping, clustering, scoreboard and reporting.

Media Storage

IPFS (for content-addressable storage) or S3 + CDN. For blockchain linking, use IPFS CID or signed S3 presigned URL + anchor hash on chain.

ML/AI Microservices

Image classifier, NLP for text/voice, severity scoring, duplicate detection, clustering/hotspot detection, SLA prediction. Exposed via REST/gRPC. Use GPU nodes for training, CPU for inference.

Smart Contracts (Blockchain Layer)

Report Registry (immutable baseline), SLA/Assignment contract, Reputation & Token contract (incentives), Auditor contract (evidence pointers), Admin governance contract.

Oracles / Relayer

Trusted relayer service (or decentralized oracle) writes off-chain verified events to the chain; signs transactions from municipal authority key(s) or automated system wallet.

Admin Portal (Web)

Map UI, assignment workflows, , graph representation ,manual override, wallet integrations for payouts, analytics views and many more .

Event Bus & Queue

Kafka/RabbitMQ for async decoupling: ingestion → ML → media processing → notifications → blockchain relayer.

Notification Service

Push / SMS / Email; also emits events that might trigger blockchain-state changes (e.g., citizen confirms resolution → triggers reward).

Monitoring & Observability

Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Sentry, contract monitoring.

2. Unique Value-Add Components (Differentiators)

Citizen Identity & Reputation System

Aadhaar-based KYC integration, citizen reputation scoring based on report accuracy, gamification with civic badges, anonymous reporting with cryptographic proofs for sensitive issues.

AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance

Historical data analysis for proactive issue identification, seasonal pattern recognition (e.g., monsoon drainage issues), resource optimization based on predicted workloads, risk assessment for infrastructure failure.

Cross-Municipal Collaboration Network

Inter-city issue sharing for similar problems, best practices exchange via blockchain consortium, resource pooling for large-scale issues, standardized civic issue taxonomy.

Emergency Response Integration

Real-time escalation for critical issues (gas leaks, accidents), integration with emergency services APIs, crowd-sourced disaster reporting, automated severity assessment using computer vision.

Government Systems Integration

APIs for existing municipal ERP systems, integration with property tax databases for location verification, connection to budget allocation systems for cost tracking, compliance with Digital India initiatives.

Offline-First Mobile Architecture

PWA with service workers for connectivity-poor areas, local SQLite sync with server when online, queue-based report submission, geofenced priority zones for rural areas.

Advanced Analytics & Insights

Citizen sentiment analysis from reports, departmental performance benchmarking, predictive budget planning based on issue trends, ROI calculation for infrastructure investments.

Accessibility & Inclusion

Multi-language voice input (regional languages), visual impairment support with audio feedback, elderly-friendly UI with large fonts/buttons, low-literacy icon-based reporting interface.
